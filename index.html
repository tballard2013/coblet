    <h1>Good Forms (Coblet UI)</h1>
    (WORK IN PROGRESS) 
    A basic metadata driven web forms library.

    <div class="example">
        <div id="coblet">
            <div class="centered">
            (Form example will be injected here.)
            </div>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
            <button onclick="initCobletForm({ 
                el: '#coblet', 
                dictionary: './forms/contact-form-basic.json'
            })">Basic Contact Form</button>
            <button onclick="initCobletForm({ 
                el: '#coblet', 
                dictionary: './forms/budget-form-basic.json'
            })">Basic Budget Form</button>
           
        </div>
    </div>

        Project todos: 
        <ul>
            <li>some basic examples</li>
            <li>documentation</li>
            <li>integration examples</li>
            <li>a builder (to help generate the basic CRUD getter)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The value proposition</h2>

    Stand up new forms inexpensively. 
    Get a reuseable pattern out of the box. 
    Get validations and a pattern for extending or customizing as needed as a free ride along.
   
    <h2>A quick intro</h2>

    As a developer, you include a call to the script library which includes a parsing engine that consumes a dictionary of metadata (JSON) 
    which produces an HTML view (web forms in the initial examples I'm planning) which gets injected into a DOM element you provide. 
    The metadata dictionary is front-end/UI focused and contains a structure that helps communicate between the front-end and a server-side 
    service handling CRUD operations. You'll need to bring your own CRUD using the programming language of your choice.

    <h2>Why did I go this route? </h2>

    In MVC app views we were creating at the time, the only thing that varied from view-type to view-type was the
    data--which included enough information to express an end-user facing web form.
    Making a swag at the contract between the gateway endpoint and the client-side rendering was quick and easy enough
    to get both sides of producing that contract started if it was more than one developer.
    Unlike pure restful interfaces, the metadata could include additional structure to help inform how error and success
    handling would surface.

    <p>
        By dummying up a metadata structure designed specifically to inform our front-end library we were able to stand
        up new forms quickly with considerable reuse because we relied on the library render engine for the form
        generation in the front-end.
        A helpful comparison might be something like swagger, but more specifically oriented toward a user-facing
        front-end solution.
    </p>

    <p>Customizations for look feel are intended to be handled using CSS to style the rendered output.
        Also, the input types are intended to be customizable, and once you've gone to the trouble to create one, it can
        be
        reused as part of the metadata language that powers it.
        That's the basic idea...at the moment, I'm fiddling a specific use-case which is driving development of this.
        If it gains traction, more to come!
    </p>

    <h2>What's up with the name?</h2>

    Once upon a time there was a project with a name that might have sounded similar.
    Despite being successful, it wasn't written in the hotness-du-jour (or well understood) and was shelved after a few years of service.
    I had a recent project that seemed like a fit to revisit the approach as a proof of concept... voila, the present. 
    The namesake had developed over a few years and with the input of multiple developers--this isn't that.
    My hope is to recapture the basics of the idea--which among other things, provided a truer notion of code reuse than 
    I've seen in projects using popular frameworks and competitors. 
    Whether or not this is actually any better an approach is up to you.

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
